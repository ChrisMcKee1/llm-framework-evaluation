    "### Production Benefits:\n",
    "- **Governance**: Built-in agent management and oversight capabilities\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents and modify selection strategies\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Rich logging and telemetry integration\n",
    "- **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Advanced Selection Strategies**: Custom routing logic based on conversation context\n",
    "- **Agent Memory**: Persistent memory across conversation sessions\n",
    "- **Integration Patterns**: Connecting with Azure services and enterprise systems\n",
    "- **Monitoring & Observability**: Production monitoring and performance optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "- Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies\n",
    "- Design selection strategies that optimize for both performance and cost\n",
    "- Use Azure Monitor integration for production observability\n",
    "- Consider agent resource allocation and scaling patterns\n",
    "- Implement proper security boundaries for enterprise deployment"

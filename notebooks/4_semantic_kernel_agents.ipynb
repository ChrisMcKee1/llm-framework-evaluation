    "## Summary: Semantic Kernel Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated Semantic Kernel's enterprise-ready Agent Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Learned:\n",
    "1. **Chat Completion Agents**: Specialized agents with distinct roles, instructions, and capabilities\n",
    "2. **Agent Group Chat**: Structured multi-agent coordination with selection strategies\n",
    "3. **Function Choice Behavior**: Controlled tool usage per agent role\n",
    "4. **Termination Strategies**: Custom logic for workflow completion\n",
    "\n",
    "### SK Agent Framework Advantages:\n",
    "- **Enterprise Architecture**: Built-in governance, logging, and control mechanisms\n",
    "- **Structured Coordination**: Selection strategies and termination conditions\n",
    "- **Role Specialization**: Different instructions, temperatures, and tool access per agent\n",
    "- **Azure Integration**: Seamless integration with Microsoft ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Framework vs LangGraph:\n",
    "| Aspect | LangGraph | SK Agent Framework |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|-------------------|\n",
